# Titanic-Dataset
Obligatory "Hello, World!" of ML. 

Most likely one of the very first datasets any apiring Data Scientist ever played with!
You can get initial datasets from here or grab them from Kaggle then follow said steps;

1. Load up R Studio.
2. Open up the script and set your working directory to location which you have your initial datasets.
3. Follow the steps, everything should be commented and easy to follow.
4. August 2018 Kaggle Score: ~.8 (I didnt have GitHub back then)

Let me know if you find any errors. Should work like a charm!
